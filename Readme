Developed a real-time AI-powered drowsiness detection system that works without any pre-trained models or datasets. Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and dynamic learning to detect drowsiness in real-time.

✨ Quick Features
✅ AI learns in real-time – No pre-training required
✅ Triggers sound, email, and SMS alerts for drowsiness
✅ Works with just a webcam – No extra hardware needed
✅ Uses DLib for face/eye tracking & Pygame for sound alerts

🚨 Alert System (How It Works)
🔹 Sound Alert – Pygame triggers an alarm sound when drowsiness is detected.
🔹 Email Alert – Sends an alert email to a caretaker.
🔹 SMS Alert – Sends a text message to a registered phone number.
