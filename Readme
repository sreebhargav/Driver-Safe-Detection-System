A real-time AI-powered drowsiness detection system that works without any pre-trained models or datasets. Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and dynamic learning to detect drowsiness and trigger alerts.

✨ Quick Features
✅ AI learns in real-time – No pre-training required
✅ Triggers sound, email, and SMS alerts for drowsiness
✅ Works with just a webcam – No extra hardware needed
✅ Uses DLib for face/eye tracking & Pygame for sound alerts
